Hat-board hardware project for NanoPi-Neo/Neo2/Air boards. It is used to generate signals of bit- and frame-clocks of I2S bus, that needed for work I2S Allwinner's SoC in slave mode. You can find simple linux driver for this board in my repo: https://github.com/nikkov/platform-armbian/tree/master/sources/codecs.
